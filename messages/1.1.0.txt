Changes in 1.0.2
================

- Enhancement: Sending commands to Matlab through AutoHotkey has 
    become faster with the new (default) option to paste commands 
    into Matlab.

- New feature: AutoMatlab can now trigger keyboard shortcuts in 
    Matlab, via AutoHotkey. 

    For instance, you can make AutoMatlab trigger Ctrl+C in Matlab
    to stop the execution of a currently running Matlab function.
    This command would look like:

    {
        "caption": "AutoMatlab: Stop execution",
        "command": "run_matlab_command",
        "args": {"command": "^c", "type": "key"}
    }


- New feature: AutoMatlab can now recognized paired open 
    statements (e.g., if, for, function) and end statements. 
    Play around with the following commands:

    {
        "caption": "AutoMatlab: Pair open+end statement",
        "command": "pair_matlab_statements",
        "args": {"action": "popup"},
    },
    {
        "caption": "AutoMatlab: Jump open+end statement",
        "command": "pair_matlab_statements",
        "args": {"action": "jump"},
    },
    {
        "caption": "AutoMatlab: Select open+end statement",
        "command": "pair_matlab_statements",
        "args": {"action": "select"},
    },
