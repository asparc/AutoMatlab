Welcome to AutoMatlab
=====================

Thank you for installing AutoMatlab!

AutoMatlab aims to make writing Matlab code fun again by combining the strengths of Sublime Text with the strengths of Matlab. I hope you will indeed enjoy it!

If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, don't hesitate to let me know.

*Note: AutoMatlab currently only supports Matlab installations on __Windows__*.

Getting started
---------------

- __Autocompletion__
  Works out of the box! Start typing or try pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Space</kbd> to see what it does. 
- __Matlab commands__
  Depends on [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). If AutoHotkey is installed and `auto_hotkey_path` correctly specified in the AutoMatlab settings, try pressing <kbd>Ctrl + b</kbd> to run the current file in Matlab or <kbd>Alt + m</kbd> to open the AutoMatlab Command Panel.
- __Function documentation generation__
  Works out of the box! Try pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + m</kbd> in a Matlab function file to see what it does.

If you are interested in more tailored functionality, have a look at the extensive documentation in the README.
