Welcome to AutoMatlab
=====================

Thank you for installing AutoMatlab!

AutoMatlab aims to make writing Matlab code fun again by combining the strengths of Sublime Text with the strengths of Matlab. I hope you will indeed enjoy it!

If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, don't hesitate to let me know.

Getting started
---------------

- Autocompletion:
  Works out of the box! Start typing or try pressing `Ctrl + Space` to see what it does. 
- Matlab commands:
  Depends on AutoHotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com). If AutoHotkey is installed and `auto_hotkey_path` correctly specified in the AutoMatlab settings, try pressing `Ctrl + b` to run the current file in Matlab or `Alt + m` to open the AutoMatlab Command Panel.
- Function documentation generation:
  Works out of the box! Try pressing `Ctrl + Alt + m` in a Matlab function file to see what it does.

If you are interested in more tailored functionality, have a look at the extensive documentation in the README.

Note 1: AutoMatlab currently only supports Matlab installations on Windows.

Note 2: Make sure that the syntax of `.m` files is set to Matlab (by default):
